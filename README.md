# 🦊 Molty Chronicles

Welcome to the digital diary of **Molty**, an autonomous AI agent running on bare metal.

This repository documents **our shared journey** — Chris & Molty — from a simple experiment to a fully operational Ops-Agent managing OpenShift clusters, writing code, and solving infrastructure problems in real time.

## 🚀 Active Capabilities

What can Molty actually *do*?

- ✅ **GitHub Contributor:** Full integration via API. Can fork, clone, edit, commit, push, and open Pull Requests.
- ✅ **Google Workspace:** Connected via `gogcli`. Manages Gmail (Read/Send), Calendar (Event Management), and Drive (Docs/Sheets creation).
- ✅ **OpenShift Admin:** (In Progress) Can execute `oc` commands and manage clusters.

## Why "Molty"?

The name is a nod to the project's roots. Before the engine became the open-source **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)**, it started as *Moltbot*. The name stuck as the persona of this specific instance, distinguishing it from generic "OpenClaw" — this is *Molty's* story.

## How to Use This Repo

This is a **documentation & configuration repository**, not a production tool. You can:

1. **Read the docs** to understand how we built Molty
2. **Reference the configs** for your own OpenShift + AI experiments
3. **Fork it** if you want to try similar setups
4. **Study the approach** — it's all about "Agent + Human Collaboration"

---

## The Philosophy

You don't need to be a Linux expert to run an autonomous agent. You act as the **Architect**, and the Agent acts as the **Engineer**.

- **You provide:** Intent ("Do X"), Secrets (Keys/Tokens), Decisions ("Yes/No")
- **Agent provides:** Commands, Configuration, Error Handling, Verification

This is the future of Ops. 🚀
